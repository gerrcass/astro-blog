    Howdy, I'm <b>Sakura Stellaris</b>, hailing from the Land of the Rising Sun,
    Japan, but currently navigating the tech galaxy from sunny California. As a
    fullstack engineer, I weave intricate digital constellations and bring my
    creations to life. Beyond the realms of code, you'll often find me strumming
    the guitar, dancing my fingers across the piano keys, and serenading the
    cosmos with the sweet melodies of the violin. It's not just about mastering
    the code, but also about orchestrating a harmonious symphony of skills. My
    fascination with the cosmos extends beyond the digital space. I'm drawn to
    the mysteries of the universe, exploring both the cosmic wonders of code and
    the celestial wonders of the night sky. When I'm not diving into the
    intricacies of algorithms, you might catch me stargazing or perhaps even
    contemplating the parallels between the strings of a guitar and the strings
    of the universe. Come join me on this cosmic journey as I balance the
    harmony of technology, the melody of music, and the infinite possibilities
    that lie within the vastness of the cosmos! ðŸŒŒðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¹ðŸŽ»
